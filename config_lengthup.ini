# Length of the upper plate is varied in this file
# Dimensions of length_up, thickness_up, length_lp,thickness_lp and space are microns (um)
# Dimension of Angle_up is degrees
# Dimensions of voltage_up and voltage_lp are Volts (V)
# Er is the dilectric constant of the medium
# Title of each section is surrounded by square brackets ([ and ])
# The parameter SetNameOutput doesn't accept any spaces in the string entered
# The value of SetNameOutput is the title of the log file which stores the output capacitance value of each section
